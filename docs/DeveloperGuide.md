### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user 
issues the command `deletecustomer 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddDriverCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletecustomer 
3")` 
API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletecustomer 3` Command](images/DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` 
(`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddDriverCommandParser`) which uses the other classes
shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddDriverCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddDriverCommandParser`, `DeleteDriverCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the FoodOnWheels data i.e., all `Dish/Customer/Driver/Order` objects (`Dish` objects are contained in a `UniqueDishList` object, `Customer` objects are contained in a `UniqueCustomerList` object, etc.).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Dish/Customer/Driver/Order` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103-F10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

(todo: update storage class diagram)
<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## **Feature Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Add/Delete/Edit Driver feature

#### Implementation

The add/delete/list driver feature are commands which inherits from `Command`. These are the basic commands
to add, remove or view `Driver` objects.

#### Example run-through

Given below is a successful usage scenario of the commands.

Step 1. The user executes the `adddriver`, `deletedriver` and `editdriver` command in the application to add, delete or 
edit the driver, which is handled by `Logic#execute`.

Step 2. The command entered is parsed by the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand`.

Step 3. The `adddriver`, `deletedriver` and `editdriver` command will then be parsed by `AddDriverCommandParser#parse`,
`EditDriverCommandParser#parse` and `DeleteDriverCommandParser#parse` to create a new `AddDriverCommand`,
`DeleteDriverCommand` and `EditDriverCommand` respectively.

Step 4. The `Logic` component then performs the `Command#execute()` method in the respective commands

Step 5. A new `CommandResult` with the success message is returned to `Logic` and returned as the output.

![AddDriverSequenceDiagram](images/AddDriverSequenceDiagram.png)
### List Driver feature

#### Implementation

The list driver mechanism is faciliated by `Driver` and `DriverStatus`. The latter is an enumeration class to include the possible statuses.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list order mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `listdriver free` command in the application to list the free driver.
The `listdriver` keyword is parsed by the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` and `ListDriverCommandParser#parse` to create a new `ListDriverCommand` with the provided status.

Step 2. The `Logic` then executes the `ListDriverCommand#execute()`.

Step 3. A new `CommandResult` with the success message is returned to `Logic` and returned as the output, with the orders of `DriverStatus#FREE` being displayed.


### Add Customer feature

#### Implementation

The add customer mechanism is facilitated by `Customer`. It is a model in the application and some of its important
attributes include:

* `NameCustomer` â€‰â€”â€‰Contains the name of the given customer
* `PhoneCustomer` â€‰â€”â€‰Contains the phone number of the given customer
* `AddressCustomer` â€‰â€”â€‰Contains the address of the given customer

These attributes are used in the `customer#Customer()` instantiation, which is called to create a new Customer when the
add customer  
command is called.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add customer mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `addcustomer n/john p/12345678 a/nus` command in the application to add a given
customer, which is handled by `Logic#execute`.
The `addcustomer` command is parsed by the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` and `AddCustomerCommandParser#parse` to
create a new
`AddCustomerCommand` with the given phone number and dishes.

Step 2. The `Logic` then executes the `AddCustomerCommand#execute()` with a `Customer` object

Step 3. The `Customer` object, which contains the following attributes `NameCustomer` `PhoneCustomer`
`AddressCustomer` is added to the `Model` with
`Model#addCustomer()`.

Step 5. A new `CommandResult` with the success message is returned to `Logic` and returned as the output.

#### Design considerations:
* The `Customer` ensures that the value of the customer name, phone number and address is enclosed by the
  `NameCustomer` `PhoneCustomer` `AddressCustomer` classes instead of `Name` `Phone` `Address` respectively in order to
  ensure
  greater level of encapsulation of data being handled.

![AddCustomerSequenceDiagram](images/AddCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete Customer feature

#### Implementation

The delete customer mechanism is faciliated by `Customer`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete customer mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `deletecustomer 3` command in the application to delete the customer represented with
the index 3.
The `deletecustomer` keyword is parsed by the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` and
`DeleteCustomerCommandParser#parse` to
create a new `DeleteCustomerCommand` with the given index.

Step 2. The `Logic` then executes the `DeleteCustomerCommand#execute()`.

Step 3. The `DeleteCustomerCommand` finds the `Customer` using the given index from the `Model#filteredCustomers`and
calls
its
`Model#deleteCustomer()`
method to delete the customer.

Step 4. A new `CommandResult` with the success message is returned to `Logic` and returned as the output.

![DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteCustomerSequenceDiagram.png)

### List Customer feature

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `listcustomer` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `listcustomer` command in the application to list all customers, 
which is handled by `Logic#execute`.

Step 2. The command entered is parsed by the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand`.

Step 3. The `Logic` component then performs the `Command#execute()` method in the respective commands

Step 4. A new `CommandResult` with the success message is returned to `Logic` and returned as the output.

### Add/Delete/List Dish feature

#### Implementation

The add/delete/edit/list dish feature are commands which inherits from `Command`. These are the basic commands
to add, remove, edit or view `Dish` objects respectively.

Given below is a successful usage scenario of the commands.

Step 1. The user executes the `adddish`, `deletedish`, `editdish`, `listdish` command in the application to add, delete, edit or list the dishes, 
which is handled by `Logic#execute`.

Step 2. The command entered is parsed by the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand`.

Step 3. The `adddish`, `deletedish` and `editdish` command will then be parsed by `AddDishCommandParser#parse`, `EditDishCommandParser#parse` 
and `DeleteDishCommandParser#parse` to create a new `AddDishCommand`, `DeleteDishCommand` and `EditDishCommand` respectively.

The list dish command will be created directly from `AddressBookParser#parseCommand`, since no further parsing is required.

Step 4. The `Logic` component then performs the `Command#execute()` method in the respective commands

Step 5. A new `CommandResult` with the success message is returned to `Logic` and returned as the output.


### Tab Display feature

`TabDisplay` was implemented as an additional feature to the UI component. 
It extends from `UiPart` and exists within `MainWindow`. The Tab Display feature was implemented with the
intention to show which component in FoodOnWheels the user is interacting with, and has four different tabs
representing the four main models:

* `Customer`
* `Driver`
* `Order`
* `Dish`

It implements the following operations:
* TabDisplay#setFocus() - Bolds the focusItem (`Driver`/`Customer`/`Dish`/`Order`) in the Tab Display, 
identifying it as the current focus of the `ListPanel`

The operation `TabDisplay#setFocus()` is exposed in the `MainWindow` class 
in `MainWindow#handleDish()`, `MainWindow#handleDriver()`, `MainWindow#handleOrder()`, `MainWindow#handleCustomer()`
`MainWindow#fillInnerParts()` and `MainWindow#executeCommand()`.

#### Example run-through
A sample run-through is shown below in the sequence diagram:

<img src="images/TabDisplaySequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

Explanation:

1. Command is called -> `TabDisplay` set to default, which is `Customer` tab
2. When a `CommandResult` is returned, it `CommandResult#isDish()` will be evaluated to true,
since the command is related to a dish
3. `TabDisplay` is then set to `Dish`, as seen from the second time `TabDisplay#setFocus()` is called

### Add Order feature

#### Implementation

The add order mechanism is facilitated by `Order`. It is a model in the application and some of its important attributes include:

* `customer` â€‰â€”â€‰Holds the Customer object who ordered the given Order.
* `driver` â€‰â€”â€‰Holds the Driver object who will be delivering the given Order.
* `dishes` â€‰â€”â€‰Holds the Dish objects that are included in the given Order.

![OrderClassDiagram](images/OrderClassDiagram.png)

These attributes are used in the `Order#Order()` instantiation, which is called to create a new Order when the add order command is called.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add order mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `addorder p/ 123 d/ sushi` command in the application to add an order of sushi for a registered Customer with phone number 123, which is handled by `Logic#execute`. 
The `addorder` command is parsed by the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` and `AddOrderCommandParser#parse` to create a new `AddOrderCommand` with the given phone number and dishes.

Step 2. The `Logic` then executes the `AddOrderCommand#execute()` with the stored lists using `Logic#getFilteredCustomerList()`, `Logic#getFilteredDriverList` and `Logic#getFilteredDishList`.

Step 3. `AddOrderCommand#Execute` uses the lists to find the `Customer` object with the given phone number (i.e. 123) , a free `Driver` object, and all the `Dish` objects with the given names (i.e. sushi). It then creates an `Order` with them.

Step 4. The `Order` is added to the `Model` with `Model#addOrder()`.

Step 5. A new `CommandResult` with the success message is returned to `Logic` and returned as the output.

#### Design considerations:
* The `Order` stores its component objects directly, in order to make future implementation easier. Future updates that targets the different parts of an `Order` can easily be implemented in this way.

### Edit Order Status feature

#### Implementation

The edit order status mechanism is facilitated by `Order` and `OrderStatus`. The latter is an enumeration class to include the possible statuses.
This mechanism also relies on the method `Order#updateStatus()` which updates the status of the given Order.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit order status mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `mark 1 s/ delivered` command in the application to mark the first order in the list as delivered.
The `mark` keyword is parsed by the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` and `EditOrderStatusCommandParser#parse` to create a new `EditOrderStatusCommand` with the given index and status.

Step 2. The `Logic` then executes the `EditOrderStatusCommand#execute()`. 

Step 3. The `EditOrderStatusCommand` finds the `Order` using the given index and calls its `Order#updateStatus()` method to update the status to the given new status.

Step 4. A new `CommandResult` with the success message is returned to `Logic` and returned as the output.

![EditOrderStatusSequenceDiagram](images/EditOrderStatusSequenceDiagram.png)

### List Order feature

#### Implementation

The list order mechanism is facilitated by `Order` and `OrderStatus`. The latter is an enumeration class to include the possible statuses.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list order mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `listorder delivered` command in the application to list the delivered orders.
The `listorder` keyword is parsed by the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` and `ListOrderCommandParser#parse` to create a new `ListOrderCommand` with the provided status.

Step 2. The `Logic` then executes the `ListOrderCommand#execute()`.

Step 3. A new `CommandResult` with the success message is returned to `Logic` and returned as the output, with the orders of `OrderStatus#DELIVERED` being displayed.

### Revenue feature

#### Implementation

The revenue mechanism is facilitated by `Order` and `OrderDeliveredAndFromDatePredicate`. The latter is predicate to include filter the order list to contain only orders
from the current date (determined by date on OS) and with `OrderStatus#DELIVERED`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list order mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes the `revenue` command in the application to obtain the revenue of the current day.
The `revenue` keyword is parsed by the `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to create a new `RevenueCommand`.

Step 2. The `Logic` then executes the `RevenueCommand#execute()`.

Step 3. A new `CommandResult` with the success message and the revenue of the day is returned to `Logic` and returned as the output.

## **Appendix: Effort**

Given below are explanations for the difficulty level, challenges faced, effort required, and achievements of the FOW project.

### Dealing with Multiple OOP Entities

* Unlike the AB3 project which focuses on one entity `Person`, FOW focuses on a total of four different entities, which are `Customer`, `Driver`, `Dish` and `Order`, with each of the entity having a similar complexity level to the original `Person` entity.
    * This can be justified by the fact that all the four entities have almost all the equivalent AB3 `Person` commands implemented. Moreover, they branch out to more commands that were not in the AB3 project.
    * Furthermore, the last entity `Order` is built on top of the other three entities, as an `Order` contains a `Customer` entity, a `Driver` entity, and many `Dish` entities. Each of the component entities also contain attributes such as `Name`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Price` and more. 
      Compared to AB3's `Person` entity with attributes like `Name` and `Phone`, FOW constructed another layer of abstraction that facilitates close interaction between meaningful classes.
    * One particular challenge posed by this elaborated structure is the need to deal with changing attributes.
      For example, in the AB3 `Person` class, the `Name` and `Phone` objects do not change after the `Person` is created.
      However, in FOW, due to the nature of food delivery, an `Order` which have significant classes like `Driver` as its attributes can have constantly changing attributes.
      For instance, a `Driver` needs to be set to `Busy` during a delivery and `Free` afterwards. This leads to more complexity and dependency, and require effective communications between developers to link the different classes together.
    

* With more entities and commands than the original AB3 project, it also requires more effort to create the relevant testcases, documentations and supporting classes.

### Implementation with Target User and Purpose in mind

* As FoodOnWheels is targeted at restaurant delivery managers, our team implemented it with the aim of easy and efficient management of delivery details in mind. To make FOW more than just a deployable application, more effort has been put in to satisfy the non-technical requirements of our target audience.
    * Our team implemented clear User Interfaces for all entities to highlight important information for the manager to view, after analysing which attributes of the entities the manager would be the most interested in.
